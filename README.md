## Abstract 

><div align="justify">With the widespread use of face masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, accurate masked face recognition has become more crucial than ever. Yet some works have investigated masked face recognition by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), these methods ineluctably trade-off between holistic and masked face recognition because of the feature fusion operations used in CNNs. On the contrary, plain Vision Transformers (ViTs) extract features without spatial down-sampling and have shown very competitive performance for a wide range of vision applications, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation but seldom in face recognition. Indeed, ViTs trained from scratch tend to diverge under the supervision of modern face recognition losses. To this end, this paper proposes a plain Transformer-based backbone for face recognition with enhanced training stability and better performance. Based on the improved backbone, two strategies are proposed to unify the holistic and masked face recognition as a single framework, namely FaceT. Along with the popular holistic face recognition benchmarks, several open-sourced masked face recognition benchmarks are collected for validation. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FaceT performs on par or better than state-of-the-art CNNs on both holistic and masked face recognition benchmarks.</div>
